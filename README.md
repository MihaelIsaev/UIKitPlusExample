# UIKitPlus Example 🧁
An example project for [UIKitPlus](https://github.com/MihaelIsaev/UIKitPlus) library 👏

### Requirements

This example is written for Xcode 11 (and macOS Catalina if you want live preview)

The lib itself works with iOS9+ (yeah-yeah cause it is pure UIKit! it is not SwiftUI!)

### How to use

Just download it, open `UIKitPlusExample.xcodeproj` and that's it

### Live Preview 🎉

To see Live Preview just go to `Live.swift` and pin the canvas
